# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe-Game Using Minimax Algorithm

***

This project is done for [Mars Colonization Program , Microsoft](https://microsoft.acehacker.com/mars) . Main goal is to developing an Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Game using AI concepts. A game in the context of AI  is a multi-agent environment in which agents compete and/or cooperate on some specific task(s) while meeting some specific criteria. An agent is referred to as a player.


## Important Points

***

Here I have created a Tic-Tac-Toe board game using HTML and JavaScript  with three rows and columns. The styling for the board will be in our style CSS file. It also includes jQuery script because the game also requires some jQuery functions.

Naturally the first thing to do is to create a simple html markup for the website and here I have used Bootstrap.
I set up the package.json file in the project folder for configuring Node and NPM for this project. Installed a NPM module and make use of it within your project.


One can -
1. Play against AI agent ,change the difficulty and choose who should start the game.
2. Play against another human and choose the sign he/she wants.

Functional programming paradigm has been used for the project.
