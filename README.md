# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Using Minimax Algorithm

***

This project is done for [Mars Colonization Program , Microsoft](https://microsoft.acehacker.com/mars) . Main goal is to developing an Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Game using AI concepts.

## Important Points

***

Here I have created a Tic-Tac-Toe board game using HTML and JavaScript  with three rows and columns. The styling for the board will be in our style CSS file. It also includes jQuery script because the game also requires some jQuery functions.

One can -
1. Play against AI agent ,change the difficulty and choose who should start the game.
2. Play against another human and choose the sign he/she wants.

Functional programming paradigm has been used for the project.
